# WU_MSc-CLIMADA_FLOOD_AUT
## Description
This repository accompanies the Master's thesis "Modelling spatially explicit flood damage of Austrian infrastructure using CLIMADA" by Alexey Falkov (2025) from the Supply Chain Management programme at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU).
## Model
The model from the thesis is an adaptation of the [CLIMADA Model](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python?tab=readme-ov-file) from ETH Zurich (2025). The code is divided into subchapters corresponding to the model modules. It begins by describing the procedure for importing and processing flood data, followed by infrastructure objects data and their value for Austria. Then a custom extension is created and for each region the expected annual losses are calculated based on differentiated damage functions. In the end the practical application of the developed model is covered. Thus, the CLIMADA Model is initiated to analyse the flood risk exposure of a specific enterprise's infrastructure.
